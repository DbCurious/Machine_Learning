Random-forest-regression
   a.A Random Forest is a Supervised Learning algorithm  which uses ensemble learning(A model comprised of many models is called an Ensemble model) technique capable of 
     performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees.
   b.It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or 
     mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.  
   c.The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees. 
   d.Types of Ensemble Learning:
      1.Boosting.
      2.Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging).
   e.Random forest is a bagging technique and not a boosting technique. The trees in random forests are run in parallel.
     There is no interaction between these trees while building the trees.   
     
     #Fitting Random forest regressor to the dataset
     # Fitting Random Forest Regression to the dataset 
     # import the regressor 
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor 

     # create regressor object 
     regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators = 100, random_state = 0) 

     # fit the regressor with x and y data 
     regressor.fit(x, y)
