# Machine_Learning

Step by step process to learn machine learning in Python.

        Regression is a machine learning method based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). 
         The equation has the form Y= a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable (that's the variable that goes on the Y axis), X is the independent variable (i.e. it is plotted on the X axis), b is the slope of the line and a is the y-intercept.A regression line is a straight line that describes how a response variable y changes as an explanatory variable x changes. We often use a regression line to predict the value of y for a given value of x.
