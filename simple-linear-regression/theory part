The term “linearity” in algebra refers to a linear relationship between two or more variables.
If we draw this relationship in a two-dimensional space (between two variables), we get a straight line.
Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression. 
If we plot the independent variable (x) on the x-axis and dependent variable (y) on the y-axis, linear regression gives us a straight line that best fits the data points,
This same concept can be extended to cases where there are more than two variables. This is called multiple linear regression.
For instance, consider a scenario where you have to predict the price of the house based upon its area, number of bedrooms, the average income of the people in the area, the age of the house, and so on.
In this case, the dependent variable(target variable) is dependent upon several independent variables.
A regression model involving multiple variables can be represented as:
y = b0 + m1b1 + m2b2 + m3b3 + … … mnbn
This is the equation of a hyperplane. Remember, a linear regression model in two dimensions is a straight line; in three dimensions it is a plane, and in more than three dimensions, a hyperplane.
